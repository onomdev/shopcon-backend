# shopcon-backend

Here is the back-end code of the Shopcon platform. Some details have been removed because of security reasons:

- Database host
- Database password
- Database user
- Database name 
- Api key/ Secret Token

## Hosting

At this moment the back-end is hosted on Heroku. A free Virtual private server(VPS). Because of this there are some limitations like:

- Dynos reset every 30 minutes.
- Limited storage, that makes certain data like images be deleted after a certain amount of time.

### Heroku hosting is only used for development, some functionalities could be easily migrated to AWS or Digital Ocean.
